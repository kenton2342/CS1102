        <h2>Core Components</h2><br><br>
        <p>There is a set of core components that collectively enable blockchain to work in its unique way. <br>
            Blocks serve as the fundamental data units within the system. Each block stores a collection of verified transaction records and includes a cryptographic link to the previous block, forming a continuous, immutable chain (Lastovetska, 2019). <br><br>
            Nodes are distributed devices, such as servers or individual computers, that maintain copies of the entire blockchain ledger. These nodes play a critical role in validating transactions and ensuring consistency across the network, making the system resilient to single points of failure. <br><br>
            Cryptographic hashing ensures data integrity through algorithms like SHA-256, which convert input data into a fixed-length hash. Even a minor change in the input would result in a different hash, making unauthorized modifications easily detectable and enhancing overall data security. <br><br>
            Consensus mechanisms such as Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) enable network participants on the chain to agree on the current state of the ledger without requiring a central authority and achieve consensus in a decentralized environment. <br><br>
            Immutability is a defining feature of blockchain. It ensures that once data is recorded in a block and added to the chain, it becomes virtually impossible to alter without the consensus of the entire network, thereby establishing a robust and trustworthy system for digital transactions. <br><br>
