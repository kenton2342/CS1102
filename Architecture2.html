        <h2>Layered Structure</h2><br><br>
        <p>Blockchain systems utilize a modular, multi-layered architecture that enhances performance and flexibility but also enables seamless integration of various technologies and use cases. <br><br>
            At Layer 0, there is the underlying infrastructure, such as hardware, networking protocols, and cross-chain communication frameworks. This layer enables interoperability between disparate blockchains and provides the groundwork for a scalable ecosystem. <br><br>
            Layer 1 is known as the protocol layer, which encompasses base blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These networks define the core consensus mechanisms, ledger structures, and security models. <br><br>
            Layer 2 is the off-chain scaling solutions designed to improve transaction throughput and reduce network congestion. Technologies such as Bitcoin’s Lightning Network and Ethereum’s Optimism rollups operate at this layer, allowing faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining the security. <br><br>
            At the top, the application layer is Layer 3, including decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and user interfaces. Platforms like Uniswap and OpenSea enable a broader number of users to engage in decentralized finance, digital asset trading, gaming, and decentralized identity systems. <br><br>
            This layered architecture empowers blockchain ecosystems, making them adaptable to a wide range of real-world applications.
